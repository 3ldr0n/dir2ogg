dir2ogg (0.10.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial upload into Debian main (Closes: #428188). This package is based
    on a Ubuntu package by Lionel Le Folgoc <lionel.lefolgoc@free.fr>. I also
    took over upstream development as of version 0.10.
  * The following changes have been made in preparation for Debian upload
    - debian/rules: no CDBS and pycentral anymore (not needed)
    - debian/control:
      + depend on mpg123 | mpg321 instead of mpg123
      + remove CDBS and pycentral deps
      + use mutagen for MP3, WMA and M4A tags
    - debian/copyright:
      + reflect the upstream switch from Artistic license to GNU General
        Public License 2 or later
      + add debian packaging copyright information
