dir2ogg: version 0.11alpha2

Manifest:
 README     - You're reading it now.
 COPYING    - The License under which dir2ogg is released.
 NEWS       - Changes between the versions
 install.sh - A bash script to automate installation.
 dir2ogg    - The script itself.
 dir2ogg.1  - The manpage for dir2ogg

Installation:
 (Not so) new in dir2ogg is the install.sh script, which automates installation of
 the script. You should only use this if you have root access to the computer
 you are attempting to install dir2ogg on. If you do not have root access then
 you will have to use dir2ogg from your home directory (perhaps you have a
 /home/username/bin directory?).

 To install simply run:
  sh install.sh

Requirements:
 - Tag preservation: mutagen (http://www.sacredchao.net/quodlibet/wiki/Development/Mutagen)
 - M4A Conversion: faad or mplayer
 - WMA Conversion: Mplayer
 - MP3 Conversion: mpg123, mpg321 or mplayer
 - FLAC Conversion: no extra software required (ogg123 from vorbis-tools)
 
Usage:
 Read the manpage for detailed instructions: "man dir2ogg", or type "dir2ogg
 --help" for brief usage details. The script is extremely simple, so you
 shouldn't have any troubles figuring it out.

 Dir2ogg can take multiple filenames as arguments, and will Do The Right Thing
 based on the file extension. If using the '-d' flag, you may only give directories
 as arguments, not filenames and directories

 If you wish to convert m4a, wma and/or wav files using -d then the -m, -f and -w
 flags must be used respectively. Wav files are deleted by default, use -p to keep
 wav files after conversion.

 The special characters '"', '*', '!', and ';' will be removed from filenames.
 The special character '&' will be converted to 'and'. These characters are known
 to break the script when fed to bash. If you don't like the idea of this script
 changing your filenames that is fair enough, but I submit these characters have
 no business being in proper unix filenames anyway. If you want to write a patch
 that will escape them rather than change the filename I'll be happy to include it,
 I am just lazy and can't be bothered to do this myself :)
