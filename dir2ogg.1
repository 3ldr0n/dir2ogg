.SH NAME
dir2ogg \- Convert MP3, WAV, and M4A files to OGG format
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdir2ogg\fP [ options ] ( \fIfilename\fP [\fIfilename2\fP] ... || \fIdirectory\fP [\fIdirectory2\fP] ... || [\fIcdrom-device\fP] ... )
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIdir2ogg\fP converts MP3, M4A, WMA and WAV files to the open\-source OGG format. \fIdir2ogg\fP is a python script that simply binds together mpg123, faad, and oggenc making it easier for the user to convert his/her music files. OGGs are about 15 to 20 percent smaller than MP3 files, with the same relative audio quality. \fIdir2ogg\fP can be called with the \fI\-d\fP flag at the command line to convert any number of directories at once, or given MP3, M4A, WMA,
and/or WAV filenames as arguments, \fIdir2ogg\fP will convert only those files. If converting WAV, M4A or WMA files with \fI\-d\fP you must add
the \fI\-w\fP, \fI\-m\fP or \fI\-W\fP command line flags respectively. These flags are not neccesary unless using \fI\-d\fP.
Note that converting M4A files requires you to have faad installed, and converting WMA files requires mplayer.

Keep in mind that converting from MP3 or M4A to OGG is a conversion between two lossy formats. This is fine if you just want to free up some disk space, but if you're a hard\-core audiophile you may be disappointed. I really can't notice a difference in quality with 'naked' ears myself.

.SS General Options
.TP
\fB\-h or \-\-help\fP
print quick usage details to the screen.
.TP
\fB\-d or \-\-directory\fP
convert all MP3 files in \fIdirectory\fP. WAV and M4A files will be converted if used with the \fI\-w\fP and \fI\-m\fP command line flags.
.TP
\fB\-r or \-\-recursive\fP
like \fI\-d\fP but descends recursively into directories.
.TP
\fB\-c or \-\-cdda\fP
Convert an audio CD into ogg. You may pass the device as an argument to the script (default: /dev/cdrom). Requires cdparanoia orq icedax or mplayer
.TP
\fB\-p or \-\-preserve-wav\fP
preserve all WAV files. By default they are deleted.
.TP
\fB\-P or \-\-no\-pipe\fP
Do not use pipes to send data from the decoder to the encoder, use temporary
wav files instead.
.TP
\fB\-\-delete-input\fP
Delete the input file after conversion
.TP
\fB\-v or \-\-verbose\fP
increase \fIdir2ogg\fP's verbosity.
.SS Conversion options
.TP
\fB\-\-convert-all\fP
convert all supported audio files to OGG. Only used with \fI\-d\fP or \fI\-r\fP. Requires at least mplayer.
.TP
\fB\-f or \-\-convert-flac\fP
convert FLAC files to OGG. Only used with \fI\-d\fP or \fI\-r\fP. Requires ogg123 or flac or mplayer.
.TP
\fB\-m or \-\-convert-m4a\fP
convert M4A files to OGG. Only used with \fI\-d\fP or \fI\-r\fP. Requires faad or mplayer or, for alac, alac-decoder (though mplayer will work, too)
.TP
\fB\-W or \-\-convert-wma\fP
convert WMA files to OGG. Only used with \fI\-d\fP or \fI\-r\fP. Requires mplayer.
.TP
\fB\-w or \-\-convert-wav\fP
convert WAV files to OGG. Only used with \fI\-d\fP or \fI\-r\fP.
.TP
\fB\-n or \-\-no-mp3\fP
ignore MP3 files when converting a directory. Only used with \fI\-d\fP or \fI\-r\fP.
.TP
\fB\-\-(cd|flac|m4a|mp3|wma)\-decoder=COMMAND\fP
Set the decoder you want to use for one filetype, e.g.: --mp3-decoder=lame.
Run dir2ogg --help to see the available decoders.
.TP
\fB\-qN or \-\-quality=N\fP
OGG quality. N is a number between \-1 and 10. Default is 3. Decimals are OK (ie: 3.7)
.TP
\fB\-t or \-\-smart\-mp3
Try to use the same quality as the input file. MP3 input only!
