So I had a request to put a changlog in the tar archive. I have no desire to maintain yet 
another file...so here is the cvs commit log. Hopefully more than you need to know ;)
If this still isn't enough try the website at badcomputer.org/linux/dir2ogg/ or else 
just send me an email and hopefully I can give you a decent answer
